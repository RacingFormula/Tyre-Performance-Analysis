# Tyre Performance Analysis

This parent repository organises various projects focused on analysing and optimising tyre performance in motorsport. Each project explores a unique aspect, from wear modelling to compound comparisons.

## Projects

### 1. [Tyre Wear Model](#)
Simulates tyre degradation over race distance and provides tools to predict tyre life.

### 2. [Tyre Compound Analysis](#)
Compares the performance of different tyre compounds, including grip and degradation rates.

### 3. [Rain Tyre Performance](#)
Explores the impact of wet track conditions on rain tyre performance.

### 4. [Tyre Temperature Simulator](#)
Simulates tyre temperature dynamics and their effect on grip.

### 5. [Optimal Tyre Management](#)
Optimises tyre usage for minimal degradation and maximum performance.
